{"body":"*\"Anyone can cook.\"*\r\n\r\nIntroduction\r\n------------\r\n\r\nGusteau is here to make servers provisioning simple and enjoyable. It provides an efficient interface to Chef Solo as well as some nice features:\r\n\r\n* Uses YAML for readable server configuration definitions\r\n* Uses a single SSH connection to stream compressed files and commands\r\n* Allows you to use normal Chef flags:\r\n  * `-W` or `--why-run` (dry run mode)\r\n  * `-l` for setting a log level and `-F` for setting an output formatter\r\n* Is able to bootstrap CentOS, RHEL, Ubuntu and Gentoo systems with chef-solo.\r\n\r\nGettings started\r\n----------------\r\n\r\nGusteau is a Ruby gem:\r\n\r\n```\r\ngem install gusteau\r\n```\r\n\r\nA typical Gusteau node configuration looks like this:\r\n\r\n```YAML\r\njson:\r\n  mysql:\r\n    server_root_password: ASahiweqwqe2\r\n  rvm:\r\n    default_ruby: 1.9.3-p362\r\n  users:\r\n   - linguini\r\n\r\nroles:\r\n  - platform\r\n  - rails\r\n\r\nrecipes:\r\n  - mysql::server\r\n  - iptables\r\n\r\nserver:\r\n  host: 33.33.33.20\r\n  platform: ubuntu\r\n  password: vagrant\r\n```\r\n\r\nGusteau only needs a node definition to run, but you'll need a few cookbooks to actually cook something :)\r\nThe following command generates an example configuration to get you started:\r\n\r\n```\r\ngusteau generate project-name\r\n```\r\n\r\nNext, `cd project-name` and see `nodes/example.yml`.\r\n\r\n\r\nProvisioning a server\r\n----------\r\n\r\nThe following command will run all roles and recipes from node's YAML file.\r\n\r\n```\r\ngusteau node-name provision\r\n```\r\n\r\nUse the `--bootstrap` or `-b` flag to bootstrap chef-solo (for the first time run).\r\n\r\nRunning recipes\r\n-----------\r\nYou may choose to run a few recipes instead of full provisioning.\r\n\r\n```\r\ngusteau node-name run redis::server ntp unicorn\r\n```\r\n\r\nSSH\r\n---\r\nGusteau provides a useful shortcut that you may use to ssh into a node. If you haven't got passwordless authentication set up, Gusteau will use `user` and `password` values from the node configuration.\r\n\r\n```\r\ngusteau ssh node-name\r\n```\r\n\r\nUsing with Vagrant\r\n------------------\r\nAt the moment Gusteau doesn't come with Vagrant integration. However, using it with Vagrant is easy, just make sure that you provide the correct IP address of the VM in node's YAML file.\r\n\r\n```\r\nvagrant up\r\ngusteau node-name provision\r\n```\r\n\r\nNotes\r\n-----\r\n\r\n* Feel free to contribute a [bootstrap script](https://github.com/locomote/gusteau/tree/master/bootstrap) for your platform.\r\n* Gusteau uploads  both `./cookbooks` and `./site-cookbooks` so that you can use [librarian-chef](https://github.com/applicationsonline/librarian) to include third party cookbooks.\r\n\r\n\r\n","google":"UA-28635242-2","note":"Don't delete this file!
